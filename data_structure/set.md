# Set

In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store unique values. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.

A multiset is a special kind of set in which an element can appear multiple times in the set.
