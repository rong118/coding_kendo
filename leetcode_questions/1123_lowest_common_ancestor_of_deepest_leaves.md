# 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

## Question link
(https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)

## Question Description
Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:
The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
 
Example 1:

>
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
>
> Output: [2,7,4]
>
> Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
>
> The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
>
> Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.

Example 2:
> Input: root = [1]
>
> Output: [1]
>
> Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.

Example 3:
> Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
>
> Output: [2]
>
> Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.
 

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
- The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

## Code Implementation
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int _height(TreeNode* root){
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        return 1 + max(_height(root->left), _height(root->right));
    }
    
    TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL) return NULL;
        int lh = _height(root->left);
        int rh = _height(root->right);
        if (lh == rh) return root;
        if(lh > rh){
            return lcaDeepestLeaves(root->left);
        }else{
            return lcaDeepestLeaves(root->right);
        }   
    }
};
