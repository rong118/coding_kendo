# Graph Search

Searching in a graph data structure involves finding all nodes that satisfy certain conditions. 

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS starts at a given node and explores all its neighbors before moving on to the next level of nodes. It's useful for finding the shortest path between two nodes.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS also starts at a given node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
