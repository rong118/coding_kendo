# Coding Kendo (けんどう)

This repository provides a summary of data structures and algorithms along with a collection of interview coding questions related to these topics.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data in computer science.

### Linear Data Structures

- [Stack]()
- [Queue]()
- [Set](#set)
  - [HashSet]()
  - [TreeSet]()
- [Map](#map)
  - [HashMap]()

  - [Binary Index Tree (Fenwick Tree)]()
  - [Trie (Prefix Tree)]()
- [Heap (PriorityQueue)]()
- [Graph]()
- [Disjoint-set (Union Find)]()

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation.
